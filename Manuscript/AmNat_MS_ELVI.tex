\section*{Introduction}

% The journal does not have numbered sections in the main portion of
% articles. Please refrain from using section references (à la
% section~\ref{section:CountingOwlEggs}), and refer to sections by name
% (e.g. section ``Counting Owl Eggs'').

Plant-microbe symbioses are widespread and ecologically important. 
These interactions are famously context-dependent, where the direction and strength of the interaction outcome depends on the environment in which it occurs \citep{fowler2023geographic,hoeksema2015context, bronstein1994conditional}.
Under biotic stress (e.g., herbivory), endophyte symbiosis can benefit host plants by facilitating the production of secondary compounds that deter feeding or cause direct toxicity, thereby reducing insect growth, survival, and oviposition \citep{atala2022fungal,bastias2017epichloe,vega2008insect}.
Similarly under abiotic stress (e.g., drought), symbionts can increase their host tolerance to drought.
However, in many plant-microbe interactions, host protection is not guaranteed solely by the presence of a symbionts; rather, the density of the symbiont can determine the effectiveness of this protection \citep{laughton2014combined}. 
Additionally, having a greater endophyte density could lead to high resource exploitation, which may be costly for the host.
This cost is often manifested by a reduction in host biomass or reproductive success \citep{faeth2009asexual}, particularly under harsh abiotic conditions \citep{cui2024review}. 
Ultimately, these context-dependent costs and benefits may underlie the observed distribution of host species.

Context-dependence raises the hypothesis that plant-microbe interactions are likely to vary across environmental gradients spanning range-core to range-edge. 
If the benefits of microbial symbiosis strengthen under environmental stress then symbionts could make range-edge environments more suitable, possibly extending the host’s range limits \citep{allsup2023shifting,rudgers2020climate}.
For instance, fungal endophytes improve \emph{Bromus laevipes} populations resistance to drought stress at range edge and thereby expend the species geographic range \citep{david2019soil,afkhami2014mutualist}.
In contrast if microbial symbiosis is costly for the host at range edge, then symbionts could limit host range \citep{benning2021microbes,benning2021plant,bennett2022costs}.
Mutualist limitation reduces population fitness and therefore limits range expansion in \emph{Medicago polymorpha} populations \citep{lopez2021microbial}. 

Ecological studies of plant-microbe symbiosis usually study the interaction from the plant’s perspective. 
Moreover, studies of plant-microbe symbiosis relied on chemical, physical and  mechanisms of endophyte fungal exclusion, such as inoculating sterile soil, excluding endophyte fungal hyphae by using fine mesh or rotating cores, and adding fungicide \citep{bennett2022costs}. 
Much less is known about how the symbiont respond to environmental variation, and how this might translate to its influence on host performance \citep{garcia2014symbiont}. 
Symbionts are promoting their own selfish fitness by manipulating their hosts' life history traits or resistance to stresses caused by abiotic and biotic variation \citep{kazenel2015mutualistic,giauque2019endophyte,saikkonen1998fungal}. 
% Plant host–promoted tolerance to these stresses by the fungi may come at a cost.  
Therefore overlooking the role of symbionts and their potential cascading effects on the eco-evolutionary population dynamics of host species  could lead to inaccurate prediction of host response to current global change. 
% For instance fungal endophyte can reduce plant vital rates (e.g survival) but increase population fitness \citep{rudgers2012there,ahlholm2002vertically}. 

Understanding how symbiotic interactions are likely to facilitate host persistence in changing environments requires an investigation of the synergistic effects of biotic, abiotic stressors and endophyte presence on individual demographic performance (survival, growth and reproduction) and how that effect can be translated at a population level \citep{bruno2003inclusion,de2006fungal}. 
One of the best ways to perform that investigation is to use common garden experiments along climatic gradient \citep{schwinning2022common}.
These common gardens experiments allow the manipulation of variation of biotic and abiotic factors that are likely to change with climate change (eg. temperature, precipitation, endophyte prevalence) and measured species response of such a variation.  

Working across a precipitation gradient in the south-central US, we asked how the demographic effects of endophyte symbiosis varied from core to edge of the host range.
We also asked how does fungal growth affect host demography from range core to range edge. 
To answer, these questions, we studied the symbiotic association between a cool-season grass species (\emph{Elymus virginicus}) and its vertically transmitted fungal symbiont Epichloë elymi. \textcolor{blue}{[Describe ecology and natural history of grass-endophyte interactions]}.
Our experiment was design to test the following hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We hypothesized that stress associated with aridity and low precipitation would strengthen the plant-fungal mutualism, such that the fitness benefits of endophyte symbiosis are maximized at the range edge. 
\item We hypothesized that fungal growth in planta varied from range core to range edge. If endophyte growth is limited by host photosynthesis, then environments that are stressful for hosts may correspond to poor endophyte growth. Alternatively, if active regulation by the host is required to keep symbionts “in check”, then environments that are stressful for hosts may correspond to high endophyte growth.
\end{enumerate}

% contributions.

\section*{Statement of Authorship}

OEC conceived the experiments, collected the data, and wrote the original draft.
GHC provided specimens and analyzed the model.
AQE oversaw data analysis and developed the code. 
All authors reviewed and edited the writing at all stages of revision.

\section*{Data and Code Availability}

On initial submission, you may use this section to provide a URL for editors and reviewers that is `private for peer review'. After acceptance, this section must be updated with correct, working DOIs for data and code deposits (such as in Zenodo, Dryad, or DataVerse). An example statement could resemble the following: All data and code for this work are available from the Dryad Digital Repository, \citealt{CookEtAl2015}). 

\section*{Appendix A: Additional Methods and Parameters}

% In most cases, authors should typeset supplementary material in a separate,
% author-supplied PDF. For author-supplied PDFs, please consult the
% AmNat_supp_template.tex document, available from
% https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/an/instruct 
%
% If you want to use cross-references within the supplemental TeX file,
% it may be helpful to \usepackage{xr} and include the command 
% \externaldocument{name-of-supplemental-tex-file}
%
% The Appendix instructions below apply to cases in which
% a brief appendix is to appear in print after the main body of the article.
% That notably includes descriptions of methods, tables defining parameters,
% and other material necessary for reproducing the MS's results.
%
% Please reset counters for the appendix (thus normally figure A1, 
% figure A2, table A1, etc.).
%
% Most AmNat articles have no more than one print appendix. If your article
% has more than one, counters for each appendix should match the letter of
% that appendix. For example, tables in Appendix B should be numbered table B1, % table C2, etc. This applies to tables, equations, and figures.
%
% It's better not to use the \appendix command, because we have some
% formatting peculiarities that \appendix conflicts with.

\renewcommand{\theequation}{A\arabic{equation}}
% redefine the command that creates the equation number.
\renewcommand{\thetable}{A\arabic{table}}

\subsection*{Fox--dog encounters through the ages}

The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox has always jumped over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox began jumping over the lazy brown dog in the 19th century and has never ceased from so jumping, as we shall see in figure~\ref{Fig:Jumps}. But there can be surprises (figure~\ref{Fig:JumpsOk}).

If the order and location of figures is not otherwise clear, feel free to include explanatory dummy text like this:

[Figure A1 goes here.]

[Figure A2 goes here.]

\subsection*{Further insights}

Tables in the appendices can appear in the appendix text (see table~\ref{Table:Rivers} for an example), unlike appendix figure legends which should be grouped at the end of the document together with the other figure legends.
